### About
Hello! It is me, Zahlia, otherwise known as Bellesaurus. I am an enthusiastic and passionate student who has been finding her love for technology through Macquarie University. I had kind of a late start to university but that hasn't held me back from taking almost every opportunity I've been privileged to be given. I have volunteered with the Faculty of Science doing Astronomy Open Night, spoken at the FSE Open Day, joined the Global Leadership Program and participated in events such as HackMac.

### Motivation for Application
I am applying for the role of President as I believe I would be a good fit. I've been a part of MACS since February 2021 and have loved every minute! My plan for MACS is to make it the forefront for all computing and engineering students to be a part of a bigger community by further promoting a safe and inspiring environment as well as holding not only fun, social events but also career driving ones. For example, after the Tech Leaders Showcase, Fujtisu reached out and asked to do many, many more events with us including workshops and careers days. Not only this but I also plan to connect with other societies a lot more, including holding cross-society events (hopefully even cross-university events). MACS is incredibly important to me, it's where I've made a lot of friends, a lot of connections and I want others to have that experience too. I also want to give students the opportunities that the university doesn't normally give us. I hope you will consider me for the position!
