## Vincenzo (Yun Chang) Huh

### Degree
Bachelor of Information Technology - Software Technology

### About
Salutations! My name is Vincenzo, an overseas (Korean-Italian) student working part-time in video productions and social media marketing. Before moving to Australia, I did my studies in Media and got a teaching diploma, got involved in dance performances in the UK, and ran an international club to promote public speaking and leadership skills in Korea. After moving around the world, I have always been fascinated with foreign languages, different cultures, and the relationships between human behaviour and communication. Whether it’s figuring out how to start a bouldering problem or draw up a unique design, I am eager to be involved in new experiences and supporting local communities.

### Motivation for Application
Apart from friends suggesting that I run for the executive team, I have a desire to reach out to students who need a ‘voice’ and further develop how MACS can welcome people coming from different backgrounds. I would like to help organise events that can promote student engagement and a healthy lifestyle or environment (both physically and mentally) with activities relating to computing. With my previous experience ranging from organising Discord / Twitch sponsored events (including one with Bandai Namco) to creating an interactive mentorship programme, I would be happy to support the MACS community that has helped me meet new and wonderful people during my first year here as an international student.
