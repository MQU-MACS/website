## Robert (Toast) Kangro - Toastee#0205

### Degree
Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) with a Specialisation in Software Engineering

### About
I've been programming/problem solving since I was about 7-ish years old, and kept the passion up to today where I've now just finished my first year at MQ. I'm a passionate musician, playing a range of woodwinds for the past 12 years, and continue that today as a Band leader and mentor. I've worked in countless leadership roles spanning from Year 12 SRC, being a Flight Commander in the Australian Air Force Cadets (AAFC), and now a staff member in the AAFC. Currently employed at a digital tech/software design education company, providing general and technical support to teachers and students who use our platform, so my engagement with Software extends already into the professional field. I'm a strong advocate for greater representation of LGBTQIA+ people in not just Software but the wider STEM field, and being a non-binary individual myself I feel this would aid in the greater representation for those students and community members who can connect with my identity and experiences. On a final note, I'll be planning to finish my studies at the end of 2025, so my time in MACS is only starting and I'd hope to be an asset held over multiple executive team incarnations. 

### Motivation for Application
As mentioned in my "About" section, I'm a passionate programmer, having been around it for all my life and knowing that I wish I had opportunities to extend that knowledge, I wish to help join as a member of the exec team to run and give those opportunities to others. Additionally, being a representative of the greater community, allowing members to connect better with those elected to run and keep the society in order. With my current leadership and staff roles within a Youth Development Organisation I come with a unique perspective of having engaged in external activities as an organiser, supervisor and member taking part, which can help shape the further events hosted by MACS. In particular I'm quite keen to propose a few ideas from what may feel like years ago, like a revamped version of "MACLAN" to cater to the entirety or as much of the MACS community as we can. Knowing that this role as General Exec will mean I'm not as specialized in my role title, I hope to be flexible and gain a greater experience from it, whilst also sharing my own to help better develop the entire exec team and have a positive impact on the community. In summary, I want to become a member to support the rest of the executive team, provide my own insight and assist in running events for MACS, provide a connection for members who would have otherwise felt outcast from MACS, and provide a safe and positive environment to allow members to excel in what they wish to do!
