## Kabir Acharya - Kebab#1337


### Degree
Bachelor of Cyber Security

### About
I am a 2nd-year cyber security student at Macquarie University, an active member of the MACS community, and work as a Cyber Security Intern for Macquarie University. I run the MQCP (Macquarie Competitive Programming) student group where we meet up weekly to solve coding problems, I coordinate the MQCybersec team (university CTF/hacking team) with Jesse, I moderate the MACS CTFd Discord server, and I have contributed to the https://macs.codes website codebase.

### Motivation for Application
MACS is a friendly community through which I have made many friends and learned a lot in relation to my degree. I find enjoyment in working with MACS members, I appreciate when they help me and feel appreciated when I help them. I believe I can make useful contributions as an executive, including maintaining CTFd/website infrastructure, contributing to hosting events, and improving cybersecurity-related initiatives within the university. As a member of the executive team, I will also be able to bring expansion to the existing groups MQCP and MQCybersec. I hope that my participation in the executive team will be found beneficial and help to support the evergrowing computing and security community at Macquarie University. In terms of the specific role in question, I believe I hold all the desired attributes of a Secretary as defined by the university [Treasurer-Clubs-and-Societies.pdf (mq.edu.au)](https://students.mq.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/1100842/Treasurer-Clubs-and-Societies.pdf). I am well versed in computing, have a stable financial position, and am good at keeping records and communicating progress and incidents. I will strive to provide a sustainable approach to managing the finances of MACS, allowing funds to be used for important opportunities such as competition and community development while avoiding overspend and financial misconduct.
