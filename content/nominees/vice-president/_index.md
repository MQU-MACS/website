### Degree
Bachelor of Cyber Security

### About
I am a Cybersecurity student with a upbeat and positive attitude who
is confident in communication and easy to work with. 

### Motivation for Application
I've felt Macs has given me a lot so far at uni and during my final year
I'd like to return the favour by helping to run it and organise some events.Â
